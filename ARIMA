#Forecasting Using an ARIMA model
#Make sure that your series is stationary i.e. constant mean and variance over time 
#If your series is non-stationary then make it stationary by using differencing 

#Differencing a Time series 
#ARIMA models are defiend for stationary time series. Therefore, if you start off with a non-stationary time series, you will first
#need to 'difference' the time series until you obtain a stationary time series 

#If you have to difference the time series d times to obtain a stationary series, then you have an ARIMA(p,d,q) model, 
#where d is the order of differencing used.

skirts <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/roberts/skirts.dat",skip=5)

skirts_timeseries <- ts(skirts, start = c(1866))

plot.ts(skirts_timeseries)

skirts_timeseries_diff1 <- diff(skirts_timeseries, differences = 1)

plot.ts(skirts_timeseries_diff1)

#The resulting time series of first differences (above) does not appear to be stationary in mean
#herefore, we can difference the time series twice, to see if that gives us a stationary time series:

skirts_timeseries_diff2 <- diff(skirts_timeseries, differences = 2)
plot(skirts_timeseries_diff2)
#It appears that we need to difference the time series of the diameter of skirts twice in order to achieve a stationary series.



#Other way 
#skirts_timeseries_diff2 <- diff(skirts_timeseries_diff1, differences = 1)

#The time series of second differences (above) does appear to be stationary in mean and variance
#as the level of the series stays roughly constant over time, and the variance of the series appears roughly constant over time

#Formal Test of Stationarity 
#Formal tests for stationarity called “unit root tests” are available in the fUnitRoots package


# The next step is to figure out the values of p and q for the ARIMA model.
